# What is version control system?

- you can think of a version control system (aka vcs) as a kind of database. it lets you save a snapshot of the complete project at any point in time.
- every change made to the project files is tracked, along with

    ## Who made the change and why the change was made (reference to problems fixed or features added in the change)

    - Later when it's required to take a look at an older snapshot/version, vcs shows how exactly it differed from the previous one
# Why version control system is needed?
- collaboration
  - if the developers work on a same project from different regions, it will be hard for them to collaborate without the version control system
- storing version
  - managing multiple version of a project in your disk can be challanging as it requires storing and organizing a potentially large amount data.
-  restoring previous versions
   -  version control system offer the ability to roll back to a previous version if needed. if a mistake or issue is introduced, developers can revert to a known working state of the project.
- Backup
  - in case system or the disk of the user breaks down and there is no backup all the files will be lost hence version control system should be used.
